#### __Problem 1__
We consider a hash file organization. The hash function determines the bucket number in which a record must be placed. The considered hash function H computes the remainder of the division of the record_ID by 4. The hash function H is defined as 
H(record_ID) = record_ID % 4

We call "bucket 0", the bucket where we place the records for which H(record_ID) = 0.
- [x] 1. Determine the total number of buckets
	4 buckets

- [x] 2. Other than the "bucket 0", there are other buckets. Provide the name of those other buckets.
	Bucket 1, bucket 2, bucket 3

- [x] 3. Consider the records with the record_ID values of 1, 2, 3, 4,  5, 6, 7, 8. Place these records in the corresponding buckets according to the hash function H.
	 - H(1) = 1 % 4 = 1
	 - H(2) = 2 % 4 = 2
	 - H(3) = 3 % 4 = 3
	 - H(4) = 4 % 4 = 0
	 - H(5) = 5 % 4 = 1
	 - H(6) = 6 % 4 = 2
	 - H(7) = 7 % 4 = 3
	 - H(8) = 8 % 4 = 0

#### __Problem 2__
We consider the following B+-tree called "Tree 0".

![Figure 1: B+-tree called "Tree 0"](./Tree0.drawio.png) 

- [x] _1. For this B+-tree, what is the maximum number of keys per node?_

Two. m-1. The root node has two keys and three children. This suggests the B+-tree has an order of 3, where each 	node can have up to two keys and three children.

- [x] _2. For this B+-tree, what is the maximum number of children per node?_

Three. The root node has two keys, `5` and `10`. A node with two keys can have up to three children because the keys divide the data into three ranges: 
	- 1. Values less than `5` (left child)
	- 2. Values between `5` and `10` (middle child)
	- 3. Values greater than `10` (right child). 
	Since the root node has three child nodes belonging to these three ranges, the maximum number of children per node in this B+-tree is three.

- [x] _3. For this B+-tree, what is the order M of the three?_
	Order M: 3 (maximum number of children per node: 3)

- [x]  _4. Insert the value 3 in Tree 0 and draw the resulting tree. We call the resulting tree "Tree 1"._
	![Tree 1](Tree1.drawio.png)

- [ ] _5. Insert the value 7 in Tree 1 and draw the resulting tree. We call the resulting tree "Tree 2"._


_6. Insert the value 4 in Tree 2 and draw the resulting tree. We call the resulting tree "Tree 3"._



#### __Problem 3__
- [x] 1. Provide the name and definition of the ACID properties
	- A: Atomicity
		The "_all or nothing property_". Making sure the transaction is either performed fully or not at all (Connoly & Begg, 2015, p. 671)
	
	- C: Consistency
		Making sure that transactions are consistent. Such as when transferring money to one account to another, one must make sure that the amount gained on the one account equals the amount lost on the other account (Connoly & Begg, 2015, p. 671)
	
	- I: Isolation
		"_Transactions execute independently of one another_". "_The partial effects of incomplete transactions should not be visisble to other transactions_" (Connoly & Begg, 2015, p. 671)
	
	- D: Durability
		The effects of a committed transaction are permanently recorded onto the database and must not be lost because of subsequent failure (Connoly & Begg, 2015, p. 671)


- [x] 2. Define deadlock for transactions.
	When two transactions are waiting for locks to be released, but the locks are held by the other(s) (Connoly & Begg, 2015, p. 689)


- [ ] 3. We consider the following notation: W1(A) is a write operation performed by Transaction 1 on data item A. R2(B) is a read operation performed by transaction 2 on data item B. For each of the following schedules, indicate if it is conflict serializable or not. Justify your answer using a precedence graph.

	- a. S1: R1(E), R1(A), W2(A), W2(B), W3(B), R2(C), W2(C), R1(D), W1(D).
	- b. S2: W1(A), R2(A), R2(B), W3(B), R3(C), W2(C), R2(D), R1(D).
	- c. S3: R1(A), W1(B), W3(A), R3(C), W2(A), W2(C).  


#### __Problem 4__
We consider the following "Players" table.

| firstName | lastName | Team              | Country   |
| --------- | -------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| Lionel    | Messi    | PSG               | Argentina |
| Karim     | Benzema  | Real Madrid       | France    |
| Cristiano | Ronaldo  | Manchester United | Portugal  |



1. Transform the table "Players" into an XML document with all the necessary elements (including the root element) and tags. Use all the rows of data in the table "Players".
2. Transform the table "Players" into a JSON document. Use all the rows of data in the table "Players".
3. Provide 2 main differences between JSON and XML.
4. The following XML code contains some syntax errors.
``` XML
<book category=children>
   <title language=English>Harry Potter</title>
   <author>J K. Rowling</author>
   <year>2005</year>
   <price>29.99</price>
</book>
```
Indicate the error in this XML code and provide the correct XML code.

5. The following XML code contains syntax errors.
``` XML
<message>The salary for the junior developer < 2000 </message>
```
Indicate the error in this XML code and provide the correct XML code.

6. The following XML code contains some syntax errors.
``` XML
<film><title>Emancipation<actor>Will Smith
<year>2022</film></title></actor></year>
```
Indicate the error in this XML code and provide the correct XML code.

#### __Problem 5__
1. Define the term secrecy.
2. Clarify the meaning of secrecy trough an example.
3. Define the term availability.
4. Clarify the meaning of availability trough an example.
5. For Discretionary Access Control, which command is used to give privileges to the users?
6. Write an SQL code example to show how to give privileges to a user. Explain the SQL code example in simple English language.
7. For Discretionary Access Control, which command is used to remove privileges from the user?
8. Write an SQL code example to show how to remove privileges from a user. Explain the SQL code example in simple English language. 
9. Make a drawing to illustrate symmetric key cryptography. Indicate which key is used for encryption and which key is used for decryption
10. Make a drawing to illustrate public key cryptography. Consider that user A is sending a message to user B. Indicate which key is used for encryption and which key is used for decryption.
